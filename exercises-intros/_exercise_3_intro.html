        <h3>Examine the audience your solution will impact, directly and indirectly, and how.</h3>
        <h4>Airbnb's Example</h4>
        <p>
            Experience designers already research their users’ needs and goals. It’s given that we will consider the people directly
            affected by our design – but what about those indirectly affected? In the case of Airbnb, designers created a
            product to give users new access to travel. However, this solution came at the expense of others' livelihood;
            low-income locals found themselves in an affordable housing crisis. Airbnb’s example shows that a design that
            serves one group can often exclude another.
