                    Experience designers already research their users’ needs and goals. It’s given that we will consider the people directly
                    affected by our design – but what about those indirectly affected? In the case of Airbnb, designers created
                    a product to give users new access to travel. However, this solution came at the expense of others' livelihood;
                    low-income locals found themselves in an affordable housing crisis. Airbnb’s example shows that a design
                    that serves one group can often exclude another.
