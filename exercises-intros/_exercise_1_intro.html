                        In his talk, “How to Fight Facism,” designer Mike Monteiro criticizes Uber’s business model as being dependent on the income
                        disparity between those wealthy enough to afford its service and those struggling enough to be willing
                        to provide its service. Though Uber purportedly aims to solve the problem of how to get from Point
                        A to Point B, Monteiro reveals that the company in fact exists at the intersection of much larger
                        problems.
