        <h4>Uber’s Example</h4>
        <p>
            In his talk, “How to Fight Facism,” designer Mike Monteiro criticizes Uber’s business model as being dependent on the income
            disparity between those wealthy enough to afford its service and those struggling enough to be willing to provide
            its service. Though Uber purportedly aims to solve the problem of how to get from Point A to Point B, Monteiro
            reveals that the company in fact exists at the intersection of much larger problems.
