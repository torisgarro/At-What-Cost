                    Many have criticized the rise of feminized digital assistants as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. Amazon’s Alexa,
                    Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana all respond to a user’s request with a docile female voice, even
                    when that request qualifies as sexual harassment. This premise seems obviously problematic now – so why
                    didn’t Alexa's voice designers foresee the backlash? As these virtual assistants become more commonplace,
                    it’s clear that this design solution solved one problem while exacerbating another.
