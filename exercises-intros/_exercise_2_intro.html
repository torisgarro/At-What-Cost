        <h2>Backcasting</h2>
        <h3>Consider what new problems the solution you’re designing might create.</h3>
        <h4>Alexa's Example</h4>
        <p>
            Many have criticized the rise of feminized digital assistants as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. Amazon’s Alexa,
            Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana all respond to a user’s request with a docile female voice, even when that
            request qualifies as sexual harassment. This premise seems obviously problematic now – so why didn’t Alexa's
            voice designers foresee the backlash? As these virtual assistants become more commonplace, it’s clear that this
            design solution solved one problem while exacerbating another.
