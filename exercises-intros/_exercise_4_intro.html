        <h4>Apple's Example</h4>
        <p>
            Even after considering a project’s problem, solution and audience, a design’s actual execution can create unforeseen impact.
            Apple designed its iPhone in a way that addressed immediate business and design goals, but adversely affected
            users in the long-term. The iPhone’s highly saturated colors and automatic notification settings are a few of
            many design decisions that encourage users to check their phone in an unhealthy and dependent way. Yet with some
            thought, designers can create a product that both serves Apple’s bottom line and their user’s long-term values.
