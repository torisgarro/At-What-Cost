                    Even after considering a project’s problem, solution and audience, a design’s actual execution can create unforeseen impact.
                    Apple designed its iPhone in a way that addressed immediate business and design goals, but adversely
                    affected users in the long-term. The iPhone’s highly saturated colors and automatic notification settings
                    are a few of many design decisions that encourage users to check their phone in an unhealthy and dependent
                    way. Yet with some thought, designers can create a product that both serves Apple’s bottom line and their
                    user’s long-term values.
