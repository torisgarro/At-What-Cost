        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Brainstorm a list of possible design features that can benefit your users’ long-term values.</li>
            <li>Plot each feature according to effectiveness and technical/business feasibility.</li>
            <li>Choose three of these features (or more) to incorporate into your final design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Result</h5>
        <p>
            Apple’s priority quadrant allows its designers to brainstorm possible design solutions to the problems uncovered in previous
            exercises. By placing them according to effectiveness and feasibility, the team can see which features to go
            after. For example, Apple's quadrant reveals that designers should prioritize user feedback on device usage,
            control over notifications, and auto-reply.
