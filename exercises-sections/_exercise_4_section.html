                Apple’s priority quadrant allows its designers to brainstorm possible design solutions to the problems uncovered in previous
                exercises. By placing them according to effectiveness and feasibility, the team can see which features to
                go after. For example, Apple's quadrant reveals that designers should prioritize user feedback on device
                usage, control over notifications, and auto-reply.
