        <h5>Instructions</h5>

            <li>Describe the ideal outcome of your design, including how this outcome looks across technological, cultural, social,
                institutional and organizational spheres.</li>
            <li>Draw a timeline for 5-10 years in the future. Place your ideal outcome at the end of the timeline, and chart
                out potential obstacle and consequences leading up to it.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have three possible timelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Result</h5>
        <p>
            Amazonâ€™s backcast path to the ideal outcome for its product emphasizes that the diversity of human secretaries will be replaced
            by Alexa. In this ideal world, half of the population relies on a conventionally female secretary. Seeing this,
            Amazon designers can work to ensure their product preserves a more human diversity.
