        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Write your design problem in the center of your map.</li>
            <li>Write down at least three problems related to the center problem in adjacent circles.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the problems in the second ring. (These do not need to be associated with the center
                problem, only those in the second ring.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Result</h5>
        <p>
            Uber’s intersectionality map reveals the context in which the company operates. For example, the map shows that ride-sharing
            influences taxi drivers’ livelihoods (“transportation” + “unemployment”). With this knowledge, Uber’s designers
            can consider adding features to work with taxi drivers, instead of indiscriminately disrupting the industry.
